Updated May, 2014 by George Karagoulis:

Made a C library for direct use in applications.

I simplified the lib interface to 4 exposed functions and 1 header
you need to include.  In theory you can use this shared lib directly
at runtime from any code, including interpreted or managed code, but I haven't
tested this.
